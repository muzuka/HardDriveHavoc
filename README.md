# HardDriveHavoc
Ludum Dare 42 game

The idea is to manage a person's hard drive by installing and deleting games.

I am in the middle of converting the gameplay from searching a list and pressing buttons
to more block based gameplay where you place blocks in the hard drive and break (fragment) 
them to make room for more.
